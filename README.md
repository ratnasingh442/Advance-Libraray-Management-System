# Advance-Libraray-Management-System
Library management system is a project which aims in developing a computerized system to maintain all the daily work of library.
This project has many features which are generally not available in normal library management systems like facility of student login with the help of 
which students can suggest books which should be added into library. They can provide reviews for existing books. Instead of writing manually they can straight away login into their account and mention the name and id of book issued which would be accomplished with date of return. Fine column would also be introduced to student login in case if time limit for a particular book exceeds. 
It also provides some general update of library like books added recently or review of a particular book according to most popular sources available 
on web which makes it more attractive. Admin account would be there so that he can add books, delete books, modify books info, view the list of suggested books and return book. Also an option to create new user id is provided at homepage. Overall this project of ours is being enveloped to help the students as well as staff of library to maintain the 
library in the best way possible and also reduce the human efforts.
